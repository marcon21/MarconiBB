## **Project Title:** MarconiBB (Marconi Badge Booking)

**Customer:** I.T.I. G. Marconi

**Users:** I.T.I. G. Marconi Teachers and Students

#### Purpose:
MarconiBB is a quick and easy solution that allows teachers and students to book rooms inside the institute, while keeping low the paper usage and the overall time consuming process of booking a room by hand.

#### Goals and Objectives:
The main purpose of the project is to give the end users the ability to book a room without the need to fill out a module. The main functions and features of our project are:
- All-in-one compact solution
- A straightforward and easy to use GUI
- A quick process, that doesn't require signing a module

#### Schedule Information:
- **10/10/2019** Basic planning of the project
- **17/40/2019** Ordered the main hardware components
- **19/12/2019** First delivery of the project, basic functions are present
- **21/05/2020** Last delivery of the project, polishing of functions and bug fixing

#### Financial Information:
- 1 X RaspberryPI 2: 30€
- 3 X Buttons: 5€
- 1 X RFID Reader: 10€

**TOT** 45€

#### Approach: 
The first iteration will focus on the basis of the project, a mockup of the physical apparatus will be created, a basic GUI will be released, some function may be unavailable or incomplete.
We will use feedbacks from the first iteration to concentrate on some features during the second iteration, we will polish the already existing functions and implement new one.

#### Constraints:
Currently only teachers are allowed to book rooms inside the insitute, we aim to expand to everyone inside the school, if this won't be possible, the end users will be restricted to teachers only.

#### Assumption:
MarconiTT internal application must be up and running, in order for our application to book rooms, we also need to be connected to the internal network.

#### Succes Criteria:
The project will be considered a succes if the team delivers an operational prototype at the end of the trimester, with the basic function working properly.

#### Scope: 
The basic operation that MarconiBB is supposed to complete are the booking of a room in a certain date for a certain hour. Additional features could be added in future.

#### Risk and obstacles to succes:
An obstacle the team faces is a lack of experience in developing web app, some other risks are that rules inside the schools may change and that the internal app MarconiTT won't be available in future.
