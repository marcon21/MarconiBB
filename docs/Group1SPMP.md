# Software Project Management Plan for MarconiBB

##### Created By: Marcon D. - Strambini E. - Tezza G.

#### Purpose and Scope
The purpose of our project is to ease the booking of rooms and laboratories inside the institute, while speeding up the process and save paper. We will use an all-in-one solution, based on a microcomputer that will serve as a terminal where the end users can book room. The software will be easy to use, fast to learn, with a minimal and eye catching interface.

#### Goals and Objective
The overall goal of our project is to allow more people to book rooms inside the institute, by making it easier and faster.

- Create an all-in-one compact solution
- Design a straightforward and easy to use GUI
- Allow for a quick process, that doesn't require signing a module

#### Project Deliverables
- **10/10/2019** Basic planning of the project
- **17/40/2019** Ordered the main hardware components
- **19/12/2019** First delivery of the project, basic functions are present
- **21/05/2020** Last delivery of the project, polishing of functions and bug fixing

#### Assumption and Constraints
- The terminal must be connected to the internal network
- MarconiTT must be running in order for our project to work properly

#### Succes Criteria
The project will be considered a succes if the team delivers an operational prototype at the end of the trimester, with the basic function working properly.

#### Team Organization

Name           | Role
-------------- | ----
Marcon Daniel  | Development of the main application
Strambini Enea | Group Leader, development of the hardware apparatus
Tezza Giacomo  | Development of the main application

#### Technical Process
The first iteration will focus on the basis of the project, a mockup of the physical apparatus will be created, a basic GUI will be released, some function may be unavailable or incomplete.
We will use feedbacks from the first iteration to concentrate on some features during the second iteration, we will polish the already existing functions and implement new one.

#### Configuration Managment Plan
All of the source code and documentation files are stored on a remote repository on GitHub, every change applied to the code will first be tested and consequentially merged in the master branch once the team has assured the code stability and bug absence.
